    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pasticho is a delicious version of lasagna that is very popular 
        in Venezuela. Its origins come from the Mediterranean, where a similar 
        dish called pastitsio is made with tubular pasta and lots of creamy béchamel sauce. 
        In Venezuela, pasticho is prepared with regular lasagna noodles layered
         alternately with a tomato-based meat sauce and béchamel sauce, with cheese and sometimes 
         ham interspersed within the layers. It requires an extra cooking step, but it's well worth it.
